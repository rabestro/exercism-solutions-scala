# Exercism Scala Solutions

Welcome to my repository! This is where I share my solutions to exercises from the [Scala track](https://exercism.org/tracks/scala) on [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org).

## About the Scala Track
The Scala track on Exercism provides a comprehensive way to learn Scala, a powerful and scalable language often used for functional and object-oriented programming. Each exercise helps to build a deeper understanding of the language and its concepts.

## My Exercism Profile
You can view my progress and other tracks I’ve worked on by visiting my [Exercism profile](https://exercism.org/profiles/rabestro).

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:
- Each exercise is stored in its own directory, named after the exercise.
- Solutions include the main implementation and relevant test cases.

## How to Use
Feel free to browse through the solutions. If you’re working on the same exercises and have questions or suggestions, don’t hesitate to reach out or open an issue!
